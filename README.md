## Getting started

### Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sosanka/quickky.git
cd quickky
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Available scripts

Check `package.json` for the exact script names. Typical scripts for a Vite + React project are shown below — if any differ, use the scripts present in `package.json`.

* Start development server (with HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```
